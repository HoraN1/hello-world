# hello-world
Here are some small programme for practice my python skills. Any comments and suggestions are welcome. It will be really great if you can help me improve my code! :)
Note: The two main word game Hangman and Scrabble need the txt file as the words libarary. If you want to play with it, do remeber downloading the words.txt file and put in the same diraction.
